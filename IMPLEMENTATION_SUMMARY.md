# File Sharing Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Server Side (`server.py`)

#### Added File Transfer Handlers
- **`file_offer` handler**: Relays file transfer offers from sender to recipient
- **`file_response` handler**: Relays accept/reject responses from recipient to sender
- **`file_transfer` handler**: Relays encrypted file chunks between users

**Key Features:**
- Server acts as a relay (zero-knowledge - cannot decrypt files)
- Validates user presence before relaying
- Provides detailed logging for file transfer events
- Shows progress every 10 chunks

### 2. Client Side (`client.py`)

#### Extended `KeyManager` Class
Added automatic folder creation for file storage:
```python
self.files_dir = self.config_dir / 'files'
self.received_dir = self.files_dir / 'received'
self.sent_dir = self.files_dir / 'sent'
```

#### Added File Transfer State Tracking
```python
self.pending_file_offers = {}      # Incoming offers awaiting decision
self.active_file_transfers = {}    # Ongoing transfers
self.pending_file_sends = {}       # Outgoing transfers waiting for acceptance
```

#### New Commands

**`/sendfile <user> <filepath>`**
- Validates target user is online
- Checks file exists and is readable
- Generates unique file ID
- Sends offer to recipient
- Stores transfer info for later

**`/acceptfile [number]`**
- Lists pending file offers if no number provided
- Accepts specific file transfer
- Sends acceptance to sender via server
- Prepares to receive chunks

**`/rejectfile [number]`**
- Lists pending file offers if no number provided
- Rejects specific file transfer
- Notifies sender of rejection

#### New Functions

**`send_file(target, file_path)`**
- Prepares file for sending
- Displays file info (name, size, target)
- Sends offer through server
- Tracks pending send

**`send_file_chunks(target, file_path, file_id)`**
- Splits file into 64KB chunks
- Encrypts each chunk with AES-256
- Encrypts AES key with recipient's RSA public key
- Sends encrypted chunks through server
- Shows progress every 10 chunks
- Copies file to sent folder

**`send_file_chunks_by_id(file_id)`**
- Retrieves stored transfer info
- Initiates chunk sending after acceptance

**`receive_file_chunk(pkg)`**
- Receives encrypted chunk
- Decrypts AES key with RSA private key
- Decrypts chunk with AES
- Stores chunk in memory
- Shows progress
- Triggers finalization when complete

**`finalize_file_transfer(file_id)`**
- Assembles all chunks in order
- Generates safe filename (sender_filename)
- Handles duplicate filenames
- Saves to received folder
- Displays transfer summary

#### Updated Message Handlers

Added handlers in `receive_messages()`:
- **`file_offer`**: Displays file transfer request UI
- **`file_offer_failed`**: Shows error if recipient offline
- **`file_response`**: Handles acceptance/rejection, starts sending
- **`file_transfer`**: Routes to chunk receiver

#### UI Updates

**Main interface commands list** - Added:
```
/sendfile <user> <path>  Send file to user
/acceptfile [#]          Accept pending file transfer
/rejectfile [#]          Reject pending file transfer
```

**Help menu** - Added detailed descriptions:
- File sending instructions
- Accept/reject workflow
- File storage location
- Usage examples

### 3. Documentation

#### Created `FILE_SHARING.md`
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Feature overview
- File storage structure
- Command reference with examples
- How it works (4-phase process)
- Security features
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices
- Future enhancements

## Technical Details

### Encryption Scheme

**Per-chunk encryption:**
1. Generate random 32-byte AES key
2. Encrypt chunk with AES-256-EAX
3. Generate authentication tag
4. Encrypt AES key with recipient's RSA-2048 public key
5. Send: encrypted_chunk + nonce + tag + encrypted_key

**Benefits:**
- Perfect forward secrecy (unique key per chunk)
- Authentication prevents tampering
- Zero-knowledge server (cannot decrypt)

### File Storage

**Received files:**
```
~/.secure_messenger_client/files/received/
├── alice_document.pdf
├── bob_image.jpg
└── charlie_report_1.docx    # Duplicate handling
```

**Sent files:**
```
~/.secure_messenger_client/files/sent/
└── document.pdf    # Copy for record
```

### Transfer Protocol

```
Sender                  Server                  Recipient
  |                       |                        |
  |--- file_offer ------->|                        |
  |                       |--- file_offer -------->|
  |                       |                        |
  |                       |<-- file_response ------|
  |<-- file_response -----|     (accepted)         |
  |                       |                        |
  |--- file_transfer ---->|                        |
  | (chunk 1/100)         |--- file_transfer ----->|
  |                       |                        |
  |--- file_transfer ---->|                        |
  | (chunk 2/100)         |--- file_transfer ----->|
  |                       |                        |
  ...                    ...                      ...
  |                       |                        |
  |--- file_transfer ---->|                        |
  | (chunk 100/100)       |--- file_transfer ----->|
  |                       |                        |
  ✓ Complete              ✓ Relayed               ✓ Saved
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Chunk size**: 64 KB (optimal for network + encryption)
- **Progress updates**: Every 10 chunks or on completion
- **Memory usage**: Temporary storage of all chunks until complete
- **Recommended max**: 100 MB files

### Security Properties

✅ **Confidentiality**: AES-256 encryption
✅ **Authenticity**: AES-EAX authentication tags
✅ **Integrity**: Per-chunk verification
✅ **Zero-knowledge**: Server cannot decrypt
✅ **Non-repudiation**: Filenames prefixed with sender
✅ **Access control**: Only intended recipient can decrypt

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Small file test** (< 1 MB):
   ```bash
   /sendfile alice ~/test.txt
   ```

2. **Medium file test** (1-10 MB):
   ```bash
   /sendfile bob ~/document.pdf
   ```

3. **Large file test** (10-50 MB):
   ```bash
   /sendfile charlie ~/video.mp4
   ```

4. **Rejection test**:
   - Send file
   - Recipient uses `/rejectfile 1`
   - Verify sender gets rejection notice

5. **Offline user test**:
   ```bash
   /sendfile offline_user ~/file.txt
   # Should show: User not online
   ```

6. **Duplicate filename test**:
   - Send same filename twice to same user
   - Verify second file gets _1 suffix

## Known Limitations

1. ❌ No resume capability for interrupted transfers
2. ❌ Both users must remain online throughout transfer
3. ❌ No compression (sends raw file data)
4. ❌ No batch/folder transfers
5. ❌ Files stored in memory during transfer (RAM usage)

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Chunked disk writing (reduce RAM usage)
- [ ] Transfer resumption
- [ ] File compression (zlib/gzip)
- [ ] Transfer speed limiting
- [ ] Bandwidth optimization
- [ ] File metadata (timestamps, permissions)
- [ ] Virus scanning integration
- [ ] Transfer history/logs
- [ ] File expiration
- [ ] Progress bars (tqdm integration)
